                Bitnet was used to connect to over 600 computers in academic institution such as the one in America and Europe. In 1987, Singapore first university, the National University of Singapore
                linked up to Bitnet. NUS played a pivotal role in bringing the country's first connection to the internet in 1990. In 1991, NUS began operating Technet which connected academic institutions
                and other research facilities. However during this period, most of the general public in Singapore did not have access to the internet but things were slowly picking up in pace.

                When Singtel launched SingNet was when the internet became available to the masses as they not only offered public access to the internet but also an email service. Two other internet
                service providers also entered into the picture which helped increased competition and help lower cost, this benefitted the consumers immensely.

            <div class="details" style="display: none; font-size: 16px; margin-top: 10px; color: #333;">
                The Singapore One national broadband network was launched and it was slowly rolled out ot households after a year long pilot programme. As compared to the older dial-up connection, the surfing
                speed was over 100 times faster when cable or ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) was used. Singtel ran the ADSL network while Singapore CableVision provided the cables services. Initially,
                the pickup rate was slow but as time went on, Singapore became one of the countries with the highest broadband penetration rates with more than 90% of households having broadband connections. As time
                went on, a new invention came around which was the fibre broadband which slowly put the cable and ADSL out of commission.

                As the world became more and more digitalised and accessing internet on the go became more essential,the Singapore government launched Wireless@SG to deliver high-speed wireless connectivity.
                Over the years after refining and fine tuning, this Wireless@SG programme allowed users to have enhanced faster surfing speeds and a more smooth login process using the Wireless@SG App or SIM
                card credentials.

                When the iPhone launched in 2007 from Apple, it disrupted telecommunication as we know it. Seemingly overnight, people were carrying a mini computer with internet access in their pockets
                which was unprecedented. As 3G service became available in 2005, it became an instant hit with usage of apps that let to widespread usage and new habits formed. Instant access to the internet
                became a thing of possibility as you could instantly search anything you want at the click of a button.

                In 2013 and after years of landing cables in households and streets, Singapore reached the milestone of nationwide coverage to all residential and non-residential premises. With this 
                infrastructure being built, it enabled superior surfing speeds which allowed people to play games at a low latency and stream network intensive tv shows such as Netflix. This allowed
                Singapore to regularly top the speediest Internet lists in the world.

                With fibre broadband being installed, the era of 4G and fast internet connection took off, this led to 4G for all when the three telecommunication services in Singapore offering 4G services to their customers.
                As 4G became more and more popular, so were high bandwidth-intensive activities like streaming videos or gaming becoming possible on the go. Now commutes did not need to be boring as you

                In 2025, Singapore aims to have nationwide 5G coverage. 5G's speed and coverage would be essential to implement more advanced things such as the Internet of Things (IOT) and even higher
                bandwidth for other initiatives. One such initiative which is known as the lamp post project aims to equip lamp posts with sensors to better monitor the weather. With such increase in 
                internet technology, I believe Singapore will utilise such advanced technologies for things in the future.
